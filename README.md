## Credits
This is based on [warlockbrawl's war3observer](https://github.com/warlockbrawl/war3observer). I created this to watch replays more comfy.

## How to

1. Start WC3 and wait till the main menu has fully loaded
2. Start war3observer.exe
3. add client/1v1-overview.html to OBS

### Overlayer
If you like to see the overlay over your own WC3 window,
make sure to have WC3 in windowed fullscreen mode and
start overlayer/overlayer.exe. To do so make also sure to download
the __ObsOverlay with Overlayer__.

### Stats for Bo3+?
There is a window for stats, I think the easiest is to place them manually in OBS.
